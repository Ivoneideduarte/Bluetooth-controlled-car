# Bluetooth controlled car
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react)](https://github.com/Ivoneideduarte/Bluetooth-controlled-car/blob/main/LICENSE) 

 ## About the project:
 In this project a car was developed with Arduino that will be controlled via bluetooth by a mobile application developed in App Inventor. The car starts on, that is, moving forward autonomously (in the next project, the function will be implemented for the car to follow lines and only then stop when detecting obstacles), only when it detects an obstacle in front of it, it stops and waits for the connection by the application to be controlled manually and avoid obstacles, once this is done, just disconnect from the bluetooth and it follows its path normally until the next object detection.
 
## Material used:
  1. Arduino UNO

  3. L298N H Bridge Module
  4. Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
  5. Support for the HC-SR04
  6. Bluetooth RS-232 HC-05
  7. M-M / M-F jumpers
  8. Seesaw Switch 2 Terminals
  9. Dual 18650 Battery Holder
  10. 18650 batteries (2x)
